          <h2>Protien Protien Protien!!!</h2>
          <p>
            Due to the increasing popularity of high protein diets, new studies
            have been done seeing the effects on consuming large amounts of
            protein. Studies show that increase your protein intake can increase
            your metabolism making it a bit easier to loss fat. Since every cell
            in your body is made up of protein increasing your protien has also
            showed to increase organ recovery functionality and bone density.
          </p>
          <p>
            However there is a limit. Just like anything to much can be a bad
            thing. Due to genetics not everyone can digest large amounts of
            protien and get all its benefits. Everyone has their own threshold.
            You can increase this threshold by doing different types of phyical
            activies which will increase the body not only to recover but grow
            muscularly
          </p>
          <p>
            And Do not worry there are many Nutritious protein meals that do not
            consist of any animal meat for you animal lovers.
          </p>
          <p>
            However futher research still needs to be done for more accurate
            results on protein intake.

          <h2>Comfortable with Carbs</h2>
          <p>
            Just like protein to much carbohydrates can be detremental however
            to little can be too. Your body loves carbs and has a how biological
            system just to deal with them. Your body uses carbs to create
            glucose and is responsible for many functions in the body. One of
            these functions is a energy source. Your body stores glucose as
            glycogen and stores this within the muscles and liver to use mainly
            for quick bursts of energy, when exercising, and hormone control.
            Any excess carbs will be converted in to fat which can be harmful
            since to much fat can cause health problems. In some cases people
            can get genetic defects where their body makes to much fat and ends
            up not producing enough hormones and the opposite could happen where
            the body produces to many hormones and does not convert the
            necessary carbs to fat.

          <h2>Fatty Friends</h2>
          <p>
            Fats are too very important for your body. Even though your body can
            convert glucose into fat it is mainly only used for energy. Enable
            to utilize the full functionality of fats you will need to eat
            Nutritious fatty foods such as avocardos, dark chocolate, almonds
            and many more. these fats help can also provide energy mainly for
            long-durations and small activities such as walking and typing. Fats
            can also help lubricate joints and cells, acts as an insulater for
            the body and helps produce important hormones.

          <h2>Fruits and Vegg</h2>
          <p>
            Fruits and vegtables are not surprisingly very important for your
            diet. It provides many vitamins and minerals which your body uses to
            help boost the immune system, support normal growth and development
            and increases cell productivity. Fruits and veg also are high in
            dietery fibre which improves gut health which can lead the body to
            digest food more easily and effectivly. I have seen many people not
            enjoy fruits and vegtables or get put off by people saying they need
            to each every fruit and veg on the planet. Luckily this is not true.
            There is a reason why there is a saying that goes and apple a day
            keeps the doctor way. All you really need is one type of fruit and
            one type of vegtable that you like everyday and you would be fine.
            However a little bit or varity can go a long way, so don't be
            affraid to experiments and find new fruits and vegtables that you
            enjoy.

          <h2>The Basic Diet</h2>
          <p>
            If you do not know where to start a good diet to follow is a balance
            diet that suits your needs. Start with trying to eat foods that are
            from all food groups and it does not really matter if you are
            prioritize one group more than the others aslong as it is within
            your calorie intake.
          </p>
          <p>
            The diet I use is a type of high protein diet. I currently do
            Bodybuilding as a hobbie so my diet is based around what gets me to
            maximize muscle growth. In my diet I have about 140g - 180g of
            protein, round about 200g of carbs and about 40g of fat a day. Which
            is about 1720kals - 1880kals a day. There are some days where I will
            lower my carb intake and increase my fat intake. I normally do this
            on days where i go out or when just feel like eating a bit more
            fatty foods that day.

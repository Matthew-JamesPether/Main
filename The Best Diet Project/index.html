            The best diet should be a diet that is enjoyable and suits your
            everyday needs. This will enable your diet to become a lifestyle and
            enhance all areas in life. Your diet should take into account your
            genetics, your goals and the options that are avalible to you.

          <h2>How to start?</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            I wish I could give you a set diet and tell you to follow it for a
            couple months and you will reach your goal. Unfortunately for the
            majorty of people this will not work. If you want to try and find a
            diet that works for you, here are some tips that I have used that
            help me:
          </p>
          <br />
          <ol>
            <li>
              Find out what your goals ares. Depending on your goals in life it
              will influence how your diet is structured. Someone that is
              training to be a professional swimmer will have a different diet
              to someone that wants to be a professional weightlifter or someone
              that just wants to exercise for fun.
            </li>
            <li>
              Find out how your genetics work. Everyone is born different and
              requires and different set of nutrients to function a full
              capacity. People that end up with iron deficiency typically need
              to eat iron-rich food such as red meats. However if your goal is
              to be vegetarian or vegan you would have to find another source
              iron-rich food such as spinach or beans. This is but one of many
              examples on how your genetics and goals influence your diet. There
              are many ways to find out your genetics one of the ways is through
              trial and error however this may take awhile. A quicker way is to
              get a full blood check buy a respectable dietian however this is a
              bit more expensive.
            </li>
            <li>
              Find out whats avalible to you. Not everyone has the options to
              afford anything they want. My best advice to you is to create a
              spending budget that you can afford and find foods in your area
              that fit within the budget.
            </li>
            <li>
              Finding out what you enjoy. There is no point in creating a diet
              that you end up hating. Your diet should be enjoyable and fulling.
              Leading you wanting to eat it everyday.
            </li>
            <li>
              Not be affaid to have a cheat meal once or twice a week. Go out
              and eat with friends. As long as it is within reason, you carry on
              with your diet and you are consistent you should be fine.
            </li>
            <li>
              Calorie counting is the most important part in creating a personal
              diet. Once you know your calorie intake you can asign your food
              groups to a calorie amount to prevent any unwanted weight loss or
              weight gain when creating your best diet.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <button
            class="save-btn"
            onclick="saveButton('How to start?','article')"
          >
            Save for later

        <div id="main_container3">
          <h2>What makes it so special?</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Having a diet that suits your needs can pre-long life your life by
            increasing your bodys defences and improve your bodies regen
            propeties. Not only that but it also can increase brain cognitivity
            allowing people to think more clearly and more productivly. Your
            phyical performance can increase aswell by reducing vatigue due to
            your body being able to utilize the all the nutrients that it
            recives.
